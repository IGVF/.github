- [`atomic-workflows`](https://github.com/IGVF/atomic-workflows): Workflows for pre-processing different sequencing data types and [sequence census](https://www.nature.com/articles/nmeth1157) assays specified using the [`seqspec`](https://github.com/IGVF/seqspec) format.
- `analysis-workflows`: Workflows for analysis of data pre-processed with atomic workflows.

- [`seqspec`](https://github.com/IGVF/seqspec): a machine-readable YAML file format for genomic library sequence and structure.
